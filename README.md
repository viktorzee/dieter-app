A mobile Application that help plan feeding and type of food to eat depending on any underlying condition, talk to dieticans and locate the closest eatery closest to the person.
This idea was conceived and designed by a dietician/ UI/UX designer Miracle Ebenezer(linkedin -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebenezer-miracle-rd-ld-735053167)
This app was built on React Native (https://reactnative.dev).
For Authentication I used Supabase (https://supabase.com)
